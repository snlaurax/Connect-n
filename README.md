# Connect-n
Do you ever miss the days where you and your friend would spend hours on end playing Connect-4 under your about-to-collapse blanket fort? Time  passed by so quickly when we played this simple game. It was addicting really, to play over and over again to see if placing a piece here instead of _**there**_ could change the fate of the game. 

In this game of Connect-n, we play with different variations of board sizes and target connected number of pieces. In main.cpp, you can decide the number of columns, number of levels and number of connections, respectively, with a maximum of 5. In this example, we'll be playing on a 3 by 3 board with a target connection of 3.
